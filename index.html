        <P>     A paragraph about me right now. That will explain what i like and what
            expirience that i have as a web developer and why I decided on doing a 
            coding boot camp and stuff. This is where I would say how much I love creating 
            things. I would love to make anything for a living but the problme solving involded 
            in coding is the most intersting to me. as I have learned more it has been a wonderful
            way for me to really relax and get into the flow that everyone is looking for.
